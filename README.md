[Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) like site where users can guess League of Legends champions endlessly. Inspiration taken greatly from another worlde clone [loldle.net](https://loldle.net).

Frontend is made with React and Bootstrap 5. Backend is made with Node.js and Express.js framework. Database is MySQL. Nginx is used as a webserver to serve frontend files and also to act as a reverse proxy for the backend.

Everything is packaged into Docker containers and those are managed with docker-compose.yml file in the backend directory. Created basic CI/CD pipeline with GitHub actions that builds frontend and deploys them to VPS.

Python was used gather champion data via web scraping and doing API requests.

Jest was used to make couple tests to backend.
## Demo
